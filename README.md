A Meshtastic device based on the [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html) and EBYTE E22-XXXMXXS series LoRa modules. Pinout matches the [Meshtastic xiao_ble variant](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/tree/master/variants/xiao_ble).

The focus is on small size and low to no ancilliary component counts. Battery charging is supported using the XIAO nRF52840's built-in BQ25101 lithium battery charger. Two Qwiic sockets are provided for sensors.
